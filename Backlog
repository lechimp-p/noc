* Think about weather a show instance is a good
  idea for the Password type.
* UI: Channel owners need a way to edit channel
  name and description.
* UI: edit own profile
* UI: view others profiles 
* UI: global channel search
* UI: global user search
* UI: How are channels separated where i'm only consumer and where i'm producer as well. 

* make permission handling more flexible

* delete users and channels

* The session handling needs some kind of review:
    - login and password should not be stored in session
    - make session an effect?

To be done:

* more tests on api
* add more tests on models functionality
* implement statistics functions for admins
* adjust size of http input to fit images (better: make it depend on usecase)

To be thought about:

* How to deal with images of different size when resizing? (scale up, down, crop...?)
* how the model is represented
* body policy and get body for images and other requests

Refactoring:

* instead of the various get/set methods for channels and users, use one get/set
  plus a record for 'core'-data 
* implement constraints in model
