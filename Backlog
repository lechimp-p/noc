To be done:

* more tests on api
* add more tests on models functionality
* implement statistics functions for admins
* adjust size of http input to fit images (better: make it depend on usecase)
* user notifications need some enhancement
* make permission handling more flexible
* delete users and channels

To be thought about:

* How to deal with images of different size when resizing? (scale up, down, crop...?)
* how the model is represented
* body policy and get body for images and other requests
* The session handling needs some kind of review:
    - login and password should not be stored in session
    - make session an effect?

Refactoring:

* instead of the various get/set methods for channels and users, use one get/set
  plus a record for 'core'-data 
* implement constraints in model
